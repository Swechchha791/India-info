      <p class="demo-h2-p">India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich
        cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest
        country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea,
        which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches
        southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east
        and the Arabian Sea on the west. According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first
        arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago. However, the earliest known
        human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago.</p>

      <p class="demo-h2-p"> India is a vast country with so many things to know about. No matter what, India leaves us
        to stay amazed! How do these intermingled cultures become a country is amazing in itself. With topography so
        varied and races so coloured, India is a beauty. Be it festivals, food, dresses or culture, each state is
        different from others.<br>
        India is a federal union made up of 28 states and 8 union territories, totaling 36 separate entities. Districts
        and smaller administrative units are subdivided further inside the states and union territories. Each state in
        India has its own administrative, legislative, and judicial capital. All three responsibilities, according to
        some accounts, are carried out in the same capital. Each state is led by a Chief Minister.<br>
        <strong>The Governor is the executive head of a state, whereas the President is the executive head of a
          UT.</strong><br>
        The state is divided into administrative divisions, each of which has its own elected government. The Central
        Government controls and administers the Union Territories, which are constituent entities.
